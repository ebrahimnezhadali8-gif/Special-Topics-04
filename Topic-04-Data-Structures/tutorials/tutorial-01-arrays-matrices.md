## 🔸 What are Arrays?

Arrays are containers that hold multiple values. In Python, we use **lists** as arrays. Arrays help us work with collections of data.

### Creating Arrays

```python
# Empty array
empty = []

# Array with numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Array with text
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
```

### Using Arrays

```python
# Print the array
print(numbers)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Count items in array
print(len(numbers))  # 5
```

## 🔸 Using Arrays

### Accessing Array Elements

```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Get first element (position 0)
first = numbers[0]  # 10

# Get second element (position 1)
second = numbers[1]  # 20

# Get last element
last = numbers[4]  # 50
```

### Changing Array Elements

```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Change first element
numbers[0] = 100

print(numbers)  # [100, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```

### Adding Elements to Arrays

```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30]

# Add to end
numbers.append(40)
print(numbers)  # [10, 20, 30, 40]

# Add at specific position
numbers.insert(1, 15)
print(numbers)  # [10, 15, 20, 30, 40]
```

## 🔸 What are Matrices?

Matrices are tables of numbers arranged in rows and columns. Think of them as arrays of arrays. We use matrices for grids, tables, and 2D data.

### Creating Matrices

```python
# Simple 2x2 matrix
matrix = [
    [1, 2],
    [3, 4]
]

# 3x3 matrix
grid = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
```

## 🔸 Creating Matrices

### Creating Different Types of Matrices

```python
# Zero matrix (all zeros)
zeros = [
    [0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0]
]

# Identity matrix (1s on diagonal)
identity = [
    [1, 0],
    [0, 1]
]
```

### Matrix Dimensions

```python
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6]
]

# Count rows
rows = len(matrix)  # 2

# Count columns
cols = len(matrix[0])  # 3

print(f"Matrix has {rows} rows and {cols} columns")
```

## 🔸 Using Matrices

### Accessing Matrix Elements

```python
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

# Get element at row 0, column 1
element = matrix[0][1]  # 2

# Get element at row 2, column 2
corner = matrix[2][2]  # 9

# Get entire row
first_row = matrix[0]  # [1, 2, 3]
```

### Changing Matrix Elements

```python
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6]
]

# Change element at row 0, column 0
matrix[0][0] = 10

print(matrix)
# [[10, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
```

### Matrix Rows and Columns

```python
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6]
]

# Get all rows
for row in matrix:
    print(row)
# [1, 2, 3]
# [4, 5, 6]

# Get first column
first_column = []
for row in matrix:
    first_column.append(row[0])

print(first_column)  # [1, 4]
```

## 🎯 Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Array Basics
Create an array with numbers 1-5 and print each element.

### Exercise 2: Matrix Basics
Create a 2x2 matrix and print all elements.

### Exercise 3: Array Modification
Start with array `[1, 2, 3]`, add 4 to the end, then change the first element to 10.

### Exercise 4: Matrix Access
Create a 3x3 matrix and print the element at row 1, column 2.
