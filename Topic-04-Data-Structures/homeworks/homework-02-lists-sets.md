## 🏃 Task 1: List Operations

**Objective:** Practice basic list operations.

Create a Python file `homework_02_lists.py` with the following functions:

### Function 1: Create Fruit List
Write a function that creates a list with 3 fruits.

```python
def create_fruit_list():
    # TODO: Create list ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
    pass
```

### Function 2: Add to List
Write a function that adds "grape" to the end of a list.

```python
def add_to_list(fruits):
    # TODO: Add "grape" to the end of fruits list
    pass
```

### Function 3: Get First Item
Write a function that returns the first item from a list.

```python
def get_first_item(items):
    # TODO: Return first item from list
    pass
```

---

## 🏃 Task 2: Tuple Operations

**Objective:** Practice basic tuple operations.

### Function 4: Create Number Tuple
Write a function that creates a tuple with numbers 1, 2, 3.

```python
def create_number_tuple():
    # TODO: Create tuple (1, 2, 3)
    pass
```

### Function 5: Access Tuple Element
Write a function that returns the second element from a tuple.

```python
def get_second_element(data):
    # TODO: Return second element from tuple
    pass
```

### Function 6: Tuple Length
Write a function that returns the length of a tuple.

```python
def get_tuple_length(data):
    # TODO: Return length of tuple
    pass
```

---

## 🏃 Task 3: Set Operations

**Objective:** Practice basic set operations.

### Function 7: Create Color Set
Write a function that creates a set with 3 colors.

```python
def create_color_set():
    # TODO: Create set {"red", "blue", "green"}
    pass
```

### Function 8: Add to Set
Write a function that adds "yellow" to a set.

```python
def add_to_set(colors):
    # TODO: Add "yellow" to the colors set
    pass
```

### Function 9: Check in Set
Write a function that checks if "red" is in a set.

```python
def check_in_set(colors):
    # TODO: Return True if "red" is in colors, False otherwise
    pass
```

---

## 🏃 Task 4: Data Structure Problems

**Objective:** Solve problems using lists and sets.

### Function 10: Count List Items
Write a function that counts how many items are in a list.

```python
def count_list_items(items):
    # TODO: Return the number of items in the list
    pass
```

### Function 11: List to Set
Write a function that converts a list to a set (removes duplicates).

```python
def list_to_set(numbers):
    # TODO: Convert list to set to remove duplicates
    pass
```

### Function 12: Set Size
Write a function that returns the size of a set.

```python
def get_set_size(my_set):
    # TODO: Return the number of items in the set
    pass
```
