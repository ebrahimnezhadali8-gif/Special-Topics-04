match value:
    case 1:
        print("One")
    case 2:

## 🏃 Exercise 3: Match Applications

### Task 3.1: Calculator Operation

match operation:
    # Add your cases here
```

### Task 3.2: Traffic Light
Create match for traffic lights "red", "yellow", "green" with appropriate actions.

```python
