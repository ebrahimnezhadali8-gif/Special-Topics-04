# Tutorial 2: Project Boards & Workflow Management

## Learning Objectives
- Understand Kanban methodology and project boards
- Create and configure effective project boards
- Connect issues to board workflows
- Implement automation for efficient project management
- Track progress and identify bottlenecks

## Project Board Fundamentals

### What is Kanban?
Kanban is a visual workflow management method that helps teams:
- Visualize work in progress
- Limit work-in-progress (WIP) to improve focus
- Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies
- Improve team collaboration and communication

### GitHub Project Boards Features
- **Visual workflow**: Drag-and-drop interface
- **Issue integration**: Direct connection to GitHub issues
- **Automation**: Automatic card movement based on events
- **Team collaboration**: Shared boards with permissions
- **Progress tracking**: Built-in analytics and reporting

## Creating Effective Board Structures

### Basic Kanban Columns
```
To Do → In Progress → Review → Done
```

### Advanced Workflow Columns
```
Backlog → Ready → In Progress → Review → Testing → Done
Blocked
```

### Specialized Boards
- **Sprint Board**: Time-boxed development cycles
- **Bug Triage Board**: Issue assessment and prioritization
- **Release Board**: Deployment and rollout management

## Board Configuration Best Practices

### Column Guidelines
- **Limit WIP**: Set maximum cards per column
- **Clear definitions**: Document what each column means
- **Consistent naming**: Use standard terminology across projects

### Automation Rules
- **Auto-move on close**: Move cards to "Done" when issues close
- **Label triggers**: Move cards based on label changes
- **Assignment rules**: Auto-assign based on team roles

## Integration with Issues

### Card Types
- **Issues**: Direct links to GitHub issues
- **Notes**: Ad-hoc tasks and reminders
- **Pull Requests**: Code review workflow tracking

### Metadata Display
- **Labels**: Visual categorization
- **Assignees**: Responsibility tracking
- **Milestones**: Project phase association

## Progress Tracking & Analytics

### Board Metrics
- **Cycle time**: Time from start to completion
- **Throughput**: Number of items completed per period
- **Bottleneck identification**: Columns with accumulating cards

### Reporting Features
- **Burndown charts**: Sprint progress visualization
- **Velocity tracking**: Team performance over time
- **Custom dashboards**: Project-specific metrics

## Team Collaboration Patterns

### Board Permissions
- **Read access**: View board and progress
- **Write access**: Modify cards and settings
- **Admin access**: Configure automation and settings

### Communication Integration
- **Issue comments**: Discussion threads
- **Board updates**: Automatic notifications
- **Status changes**: Progress visibility

## Advanced Board Features

### Sub-issues (Beta)
- Break complex issues into smaller tasks
- Hierarchical task management
- Progress tracking at multiple levels

### Custom Fields
- **Priority levels**: High, Medium, Low
- **Story points**: Effort estimation
- **Due dates**: Timeline tracking
- **Custom metadata**: Project-specific fields

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Keep it simple**: Start with basic columns, add complexity as needed
2. **Regular maintenance**: Review and update boards weekly
3. **Team alignment**: Ensure everyone understands board workflow
4. **Automation leverage**: Use automation to reduce manual work
5. **Progress focus**: Use boards for daily standup discussions
